# Movie Industry Analysis: Factors Influencing Success and Popularity

This project analyzes a comprehensive dataset of over 4,800 movies to uncover insights about the film industry. Using Python and various data analysis libraries, it explores relationships between factors such as budget, revenue, popularity, and audience ratings. The analysis includes data visualization, statistical testing, and predictive modeling to understand trends in movie runtimes, the impact of budget on success, genre influences on ratings, and the financial performance of films across different languages. In project we used techniques like correlation analysis (heat maps, to be more specific), hypothesis testing, and linear regression.
